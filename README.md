# Ghost Pub: A Haunted Pub Simulator Game

Welcome to Ghost Pub, a collaborative project between Jason Bube and Jackson Zenti, where we've combined our passion for game development and creativity to bring you a unique top-down movement/simulator game experience.

## About the Game

Ghost Pub is a top-down game built using the Unity Game Engine. Players navigate through their pub attempting to keep it afloat by selling as much beer as possible to their spectral customers. The game features intricate player movement mechanics, including acceleration, deceleration, and a stamina system, adding depth and realism to the gameplay.

## Key Features

- **Immersive Movement Mechanics:** Experience fluid and responsive player movement, thanks to the carefully programmed mechanics.
- **Retro Style Music:** Dive into nostalgia with our 16-bit style music, composed using old SoundFonts from the Sega Genesis, enhancing the overall gaming experience.

## How to Play

Ghost Pub offers an engaging and intuitive gameplay experience. Simply download the game, navigate through the bar using the _arrow keys_, or the keys _WASD_. You can also use _SHIFT_ to sprint and _Spacebar_ to dash!

## Development Details

- **Version Control and DevOps:** By implementing robust version control and DevOps practices, we've streamlined our development process, enabling smooth collaboration and efficient project management.
- **Music Composition:** In addition to game development, we've composed a distinctive 16-bit style song to complement the retro aesthetics of Ghost Pub.
